  Manages IBM Storage Block.

# ibm\_storage_block

Provides a resource to create, update, and delete iSCSI-based [Endurance](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/endurance-storage) and [Performance](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/performance-storage) block storage.

Block storage can be accessed and mounted through a Multipath I/O (MPIO) Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) connection.

To access block storage, see the KnowledgeLayer docs [for Linux](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/block-storage-linux) or [for Windows](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/accessing-block-storage-microsoft-windows).

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create 20G of Endurance block storage with 10G snapshot capacity and 0.25 IOPS/GB.

```hcl
resource "ibm_storage_block" "test1" {
        type = "Endurance"
        datacenter = "dal05"
        capacity = 20
        iops = 0.25
        os_format_type = "Linux"

        # Optional fields
        allowed_virtual_guest_ids = [ 27699397 ]
        allowed_ip_addresses = ["10.40.98.193", "10.40.98.200"]
        snapshot_capacity = 10
}
```

In the following example, you can create 20G of Performance block storage and 100 IOPS.

```hcl
resource "ibm_storage_block" "test2" {
        type = "Performance"
        datacenter = "dal05"
        capacity = 20
        iops = 100
        os_format_type = "Linux"

        # Optional fields
        allowed_virtual_guest_ids = [ 27699397 ]
        allowed_ip_addresses = ["10.40.98.193", "10.40.98.200"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `type` - (Required, string) The type of the storage. Accepted values are `Endurance` and `Performance`.
* `datacenter` - (Required, string) The data center the instance is to be provisioned in.
* `capacity` - (Required, integer) The amount of storage capacity to allocate, specified in gigabytes.
* `iops` - (Required, float) The IOPS value for the storage. You can find available values for Endurance storage in the [Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) docs](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/learning/introduction-endurance-storage).
* `os_format_type` - (Required, string) Specifies which OS type to use when formatting the storage space. This should match the OS type that will be connecting to the LUN.
* `snapshot_capacity` - (Optional, integer) The amount of snapshot capacity to allocate, specified in gigabytes. Only applies to Endurance storage.
* `allowed_virtual_guest_ids` - (Optional, array of integers) Specifies allowed virtual guests. Virtual guests need to be in the same data center.
* `allowed_hardware_ids` - (Optional, array of integers) Specifies allowed bare metal servers. Bare metal servers need to be in the same data center.
* `allowed_ip_addresses` - (Optional, array of string) Specifies allowed IP addresses. IP addresses need to be in the same data center.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Identifier of the storage.
* `hostname` - The fully qualified domain name of the storage.
* `volumename` - The name of the storage volume.
* `allowed_virtual_guest_info` - Contains user name, password and host IQN of the virtual guests with access to the storage.
* `allowed_hardware_info` - Contains user name, password and host IQN of the bare metal servers with access to the storage.
