  Manages IBM Firewall Policy.

# ibm\_firewall_policy

Represents rules for firewall resources in IBM. One rule resource is allowed per firewall, however a rule resource can contain multiple firewall rules within it. 

For more details about how to configure a firewall, see the [docs](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/configure-hardware-firewall-dedicated).

**NOTE**: The target VLAN should have at least one subnet for rule configuration. To express any IP addresses externally, configure `src_ip_address` as `0.0.0.0` and `src_ip_cidr` as `0`. To express API IP addresses internally, configure `dst_ip_address` as `any` and `src_ip_cidr` as `32`. 

When this rules resource is created, it cannot be deleted. IBM does not allow entire rule deletion. 

Firewalls should have at least one rule. If Terraform destroys the rules resources, _permit from any to any with TCP, UDP, ICMP, GRE, PPTP, ESP, and HA_ rules will be configured. 
 
## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_firewall" "demofw" {
  ha_enabled = false
  public_vlan_id = 1234567
}

resource "ibm_firewall_policy" "rules" {
 firewall_id = "${ibm_firewall.demofw.id}"
 rules = {
      "action" = "permit"
      "src_ip_address"= "10.1.1.0"
      "src_ip_cidr"= 24
      "dst_ip_address"= "any"
      "dst_ip_cidr"= 32
      "dst_port_range_start"= 80
      "dst_port_range_end"= 80
      "notes"= "Permit from 10.1.1.0"
      "protocol"= "udp"
 }
  rules = {
       "action" = "deny"
       "src_ip_address"= "10.1.1.0"
       "src_ip_cidr"= 24
       "dst_ip_address"= "any"
       "dst_ip_cidr"= 32
       "dst_port_range_start"= 81
       "dst_port_range_end"= 81
       "notes"= "Permit from 10.1.1.0"
       "protocol"= "udp"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `firewall_id` - (Required, integer) Device ID for the target hardware firewall.
* `rules` - (Required, array) Represents firewall rules. At least one rule is required.
* `rules.action` - (Required, string) Allow or deny traffic when rules are matched. Accepted values are `permit` or `deny`.
* `rules.src_ip_address` - (Required, string) Set either a specific IP address or the network address for a specific subnet.
* `rules.src_ip_cidr` - (Required, string) Indicate the standard CIDR notation for the selected source. `32` implements the rule for a single IP while, for example, `24` implements the rule for 256 IPs.
* `rules.dst_ip_address` - (Required, string) Set `any`, a specific IP address, or the network address for a specific subnet.
* `rules.dst_ip_cidr` - (Required, string) Indicates the standard CIDR notation for the selected destination.
* `rules.dst_port_range_start` - (Optional, string) The range of ports for TCP and UDP. Accepted values are `1` to `65535`. 
* `rules.dst_port_range_end` - (Optional, string) The range of ports for TCP and UDP. Accepted values are `1` `65535`. 
* `rules.notes` - (Optional, string) Comments for the rule.
* `rules.protocol` - (Required, string) Protocol for the rule. Accepted values are `tcp`,`udp`,`icmp`,`gre`,`pptp`,`ah`,`esp`.
