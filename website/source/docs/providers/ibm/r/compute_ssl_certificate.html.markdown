# ibm\_compute_ssl_certificate

Create, update, and destroy [Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) security certificates](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Security_Certificate).

## Example Usage

Using certificates on file:

```hcl
resource "ibm_compute_ssl_certificate" "test_cert" {
  certificate = "${file("cert.pem")}"
  private_key = "${file("key.pem")}"
}
```

Example with the in-line certificates:

```hcl
resource "ibm_compute_ssl_certificate" "test_cert" {
    certificate = <<EOF
[......] # cert contents
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
    EOF

    private_key = <<EOF
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
[......] # cert contents
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    EOF
}
```

* `certificate` - (Required, string) The certificate provided publicly to clients requesting identity credentials.

* `modify_date` - The date the certificate record was last modified.
* `organization_name` - The organizational name encoded in the certificate.
* `validity_begin` - The UTC timestamp representing the beginning of the certificate's validity.
