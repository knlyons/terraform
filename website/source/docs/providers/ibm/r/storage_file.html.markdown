  Manages IBM Storage File.

# ibm\_storage_file

Provides a file storage resource. This allows NFS-based [Endurance](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/endurance-storage) and [Performance](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/performance-storage) to be created, updated, and deleted.

File storage is mounted using the NFS protocol. For example, if the `hostname` of the file storage resource is `nfsdal0501a.service.softlayer.com` and the `volumename` is` IBM01SV278685_7`, the mount point would be `nfsdal0501a.service.softlayer.com:\IBM01SV278685_7`. 

See [accessing file store on Linux](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/accessing-file-storage-linux) for NFS configuration of Linux systems. For additional details, please refer to the [file storage docs](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/file-storage) and the [file storage overview](http://www.softlayer.com/file-storage).

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create 20G of Endurance file storage with a 10G snapshot capacity and 0.25 IOPS/GB.

```hcl
resource "ibm_storage_file" "fs_endurance" {
        type = "Endurance"
        datacenter = "dal06"
        capacity = 20
        iops = 0.25
        
        # Optional fields
        allowed_virtual_guest_ids = [ "28961689" ]
        allowed_subnets = [ "10.146.139.64/26" ]
        allowed_ip_addresses = [ "10.146.139.84" ]
        snapshot_capacity = 10  
        
        #Optional fields for snapshot
        
        snapshot = [
  		{
			scheduleType="WEEKLY",
			retentionCount= 20,
			minute= 2,
			hour= 13,
			dayOfWeek= "SUNDAY",
			enable= true
		},
		{
			scheduleType="HOURLY",
			retentionCount= 20,
			minute= 2,
			enable= true
		},
 		]		
}

```

In the following example, you can create 20G of Performance file storage with 100 IOPS.

```hcl
resource "ibm_storage_file" "fs_performance" {
        type = "Performance"
        datacenter = "dal06"
        capacity = 20
        iops = 100
        # Optional fields
        allowed_virtual_guest_ids = [ "28961689" ]
        allowed_subnets = [ "10.146.139.64/26" ]
        allowed_ip_addresses = [ "10.146.139.84" ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `type` - (Required, string) The type of the storage. Accepted values are `Endurance` and `Performance`.
* `datacenter` - (Required, string) The data center the file storage instance is to be provisioned in.
* `capacity` - (Required, integer) The amount of storage capacity to allocate, expressed in gigabytes.
* `iops` - (Required, float) The IOPS value for the storage instance. Available values for Endurance storage can be found in the [KnowledgeLayer docs](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/learning/introduction-endurance-storage).
* `snapshot_capacity` - (Optional, integer) The amount of snapshot capacity to allocate, expressed in gigabytes. Only applies to `Endurance` storage.
* `allowed_virtual_guest_ids` - (Optional, array of integers) Specify allowed virtual guests. Virtual guests need to be in the same data center.
* `allowed_hardware_ids`- (Optional, array of integers) Specify allowed bare metal servers. Bare metal servers need to be in the same data center.
* `allowed_subnets` - (Optional, array of integers) Specify allowed subnets. Subnets should be in the same data center.
* `allowed_ip_addresses` - (Optional, array of integers) Specify allowed IP addresses. IP addresses need to be in the same data center.
* `snapshot` - (Optional) Specifies the parameter required for a snapshot schedule. Only applies to Endurance storage.
* `scheduleType` - (String) Specifies the snapshot schedule type. Accepted values are `HOURLY`, `WEEKLY`, and `DAILY`.
* `retentionCount` - (Integer) Specifies the retention count. Required for all types of `scheduleType`.
* `minute` - (Integer) Specifies the minute. Required for all types of `scheduleType`.
* `hour` - (Integer) Specifies the hour. Required if `scheduleType` is set to `DAILY` and `WEEKLY`.
* `dayOfWeek` - (string) Specifies the day of the week. Required if the `scheduleType` is set to `WEEKLY`.
* `enable` - (boolean) Specifies whether to disable the already created snapshot.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Identifier of the storage volume.
* `hostname` - The fully qualified domain name of the storage. 
* `volumename` - The name of the storage volume.
